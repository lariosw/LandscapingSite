            Your student will experience many opportunities for learning during
            his/her week at preschool.  Each day is geared to a specific theme,
            letter and/or number.  During the day your student will explore the
            theme through circle time, station time, academic work, art projects
            and other activities.
            The preschool program is specifically designed for the children in
            attendance each day. Teacher Barbara works with the younger than pre-k
            students.  Students who are pre-k will spend  class time with Teacher
            Nancy preparing themselves for kindergarten.  Through the weekly theme
            and letter, your student will develop a foundation of skills and be excited
            and ready for their next educational experience.
