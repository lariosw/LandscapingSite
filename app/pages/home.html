            <p class="col-xs-12">Our mission is to provide a quality educational and social experience in a Christian environment and to
                ensure that children are prepared to enter Kindergarten. We promote learning through work and play under
                the guidance of qualified teachers.

                The program at Maplewood Preschool balance academics and social development through art, music, large
                muscle time, fine motor skills, field trips and community involvement.

                Our program is designed to help children learn that God is part of their everyday lives. The curriculum
                will reflect this through Bible stories, songs, chapel time, and with love and kindness in the classroom.</p>
